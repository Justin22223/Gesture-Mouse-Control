# Project Synopsis

## Project Title: Gesture-Mouse-Control

### Project Overview:

The Gesture-Mouse-Control project aims to provide an innovative and hands-free approach to computer 
mouse control using hand gestures captured through a webcam. Leveraging computer vision techniques, the system interprets 
these gestures in real-time, translating them into corresponding mouse movements and actions. This intuitive and user-friendly 
solution offers an alternative method for individuals with physical limitations, as well as users looking
for a novel and interactive way to interact with their computers.

### Key Features:

1. **Gesture Recognition:**
   - Utilizes computer vision algorithms for real-time recognition and interpretation of hand gestures.
   - Enables users to control the computer mouse without physical contact.

2. **Mouse Control:**
   - Translates recognized gestures into precise and responsive mouse movements.
   - Supports common mouse actions such as cursor movement, left-click, and right-click.

3. **Click Actions:**
   - Allows users to perform click actions by associating specific hand gestures with left-click and right-click commands.

4. **Intuitive Interface:**
   - Simple and accessible user interface to facilitate ease of use for individuals with varying technical proficiency.

5. **Customization:**
   - Permits users to customize gesture-to-action mappings according to personal preferences and specific requirements.
